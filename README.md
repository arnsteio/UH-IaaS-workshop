## Notes on teaching
Participants should be given the URL of the web site immediately, this will save typing. 
This workshop is very helper heavy. 

## Notes on structure
External participants get CLI access, not GUI access.
UiO-internal participants should follow the workshop as it is set out above.
Others should get help installing openstack-cli (6) while we do GUI stuff in plenary.
They will be issued a keystone.sh file for the course project and can follow the workshop in CLI.
Main problem will be adding SSH keys and security groups, this is easy via CLI if a recipe is provided
